            <p>I'm trying to learn and this is very difficult. I wish I would have taken school more        seriously when I was younger. Video games and a lack of self control contributed to where I am today. I wish that I could roll back the hands of time, but alas, I can not. So, here I am at age 29 relearning things I have forgotten over time and struggling to keep a grip. The only way is forward and I must keep that thought in the forefront of my mind. ONWARD AND UPWARD!</p>
